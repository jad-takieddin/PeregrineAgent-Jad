# PeregrineAgent-Jad


I built this AI Agent to help officers quickly track and locate suspects using only the details they already have in the field — license plate number (full or partial), vehicle color, make/model, distinguishing features, and last known location.

Instead of manually searching across disconnected systems, the agent instantly unifies real-time and historical signals (ALPR hits, CAD/dispatch notes, BOLOs, prior incidents, and camera networks where available) to generate a clear, ranked set of leads. It can identify likely plate matches even with partial reads, flag inconsistencies (e.g., plate doesn’t match the vehicle description), and surface the most relevant sightings with timestamps, maps, and confidence scoring.

Officers get an immediate “next best action” workflow: recommended search radius, likely travel routes, nearby camera locations, and nearby units to notify — all in a simple interface built for speed and accuracy. The result is faster suspect identification, fewer missed leads, and safer, more coordinated responses during active investigations.
